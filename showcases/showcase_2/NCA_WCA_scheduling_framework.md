# ðŸ¥… Goal
This showcase provides a step-by-step walkthrough of TAS-Forgeâ€™s workflow for comparing two scheduling frameworks applied to the same network topology. It demonstrates the full TAS-Forge generation process using both the **Network-Derived Clock Drift Delay (NCD)** and **Worst-Case Delay (WCD)** scheduling methods.

The network topology considered consists of **6 switches**, **5 sources** and **5 sinks**.
