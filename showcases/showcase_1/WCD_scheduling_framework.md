This showcase provides a practical walkthrough of TAS-Forge’s capabilities.

It demonstrates the complete process of generating TAS schedules using the **Worst-Case Delay (WCD)** scheduling framework on a network topology consisting of **5 switches**, **5 sources**, and **4 sinks**.

The showcase highlights each major phase: 
- Topology creation and stream generation
- Solve the TAS schedule using IBM CPLEX
- Creation of GCLs based on CPLEX outputs
- Simulation preparation
- Analysis of simulation results

The overall objective is to demonstrate how TAS-Forge automates the scheduling process efficiently and systematically.
