# ‚öΩ Goal
This showcase provides a complete walkthrough of TAS-Forge‚Äôs workflow through a hands-on example. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of generating Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) schedules using the Worst-Case Delay (WCD) scheduling framework.

It demonstrates the complete process of generating TAS schedules using the **Worst-Case Delay (WCD)** scheduling framework on a network topology consisting of **5 switches**, **5 sources**, and **4 sinks**.

The showcase highlights each major phase: 
- Automatic generation of the network topology and time-sensitive streams
- Formulation of TAS scheduling constraints considering time synchronization
- Solving the scheduling problem using CPLEX
- Generation of Gate Control Lists (GCLs)
- Preparation of simulation files for OMNeT++

This example highlights how TAS-Forge simplifies TAS schedule creation, allowing users to generate, validate, and analyze time-sensitive network schedules efficiently.

# üè† Step-by-Step Showcase: Creating TAS Schedules with TAS-Forge
This showcase follows the step-by-step walkthrough as detailed in the [User Guide](../../documentation/User_Guide.md). 

## üèóÔ∏è Step 1: Configure the Network Topology
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the TAS-Forge project folder.
- Run the following script:
  <pre>
  generate_network_system  
  </pre>
- Enter the number of üü• **sources**, üü¢ **sinks** & üü¶ **switches** in the input text box as shown below:
  
![Input Prompt](images/input_prompt.png)

- A network topology will be automatically generated and displayed as shown below:

![Network Topology](images/network_topology.png)

- The script also generates a set of **source-to-sink** routes:
<pre>
Source to Sink Pairs:
source5 ---> sink1
source4 ---> sink2
source1 ---> sink3
source2 ---> sink4
source3 ---> sink3  
</pre>

- The `generate_network_system.m` script also generates `.csv` files containing information relevant to:
    - Network parameters
    - Node clock drift information
    - Stream definition and properties
- The creation of `.csv` files will be prompted in the MATLAB command window.
<pre>
Node output file "node_data.csv" has been created.
Network output file "network_data.csv" has been created.
Stream output file "stream_data.csv" has been created.
Port connections output file "port_connections.csv" has been created.  
</pre> 
- The script also creates the `CPLEX_Code_Output` folder containing the `.mod` files for all scheduling frameworks.
<pre>
Directory created for storing CPLEX codes.
Output file "output_CPLEX_code_generator_WCD.mod" has been generated in the CPLEX_Code_Output folder.
Output file "output_CPLEX_code_generator_NCD.mod" has been generated in the CPLEX_Code_Output folder.
Output file "output_CPLEX_code_generator_WCA.mod" has been generated in the CPLEX_Code_Output folder.
Output file "output_CPLEX_code_generator_NCA.mod" has been generated in the CPLEX_Code_Output folder.  
</pre>
- An empty text file `inpute_cplex_solution.txt` is also generated to enter the outputs from IBM CPLEX as explained in Step 2.
<pre>
Empty text file to input solution generated by CPLEX has been created.
</pre>
