# ‚öΩ Goal
This showcase provides a complete walkthrough of TAS-Forge‚Äôs workflow through a hands-on example. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of generating Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) schedules using the Worst-Case Delay (WCD) scheduling framework.

It demonstrates the complete process of generating TAS schedules using the **Worst-Case Delay (WCD)** scheduling framework on a network topology consisting of **5 switches**, **5 sources**, and **4 sinks**.

The showcase highlights each major phase: 
- Automatic generation of the network topology and time-sensitive streams
- Formulation of TAS scheduling constraints considering time synchronization
- Solving the scheduling problem using CPLEX
- Generation of Gate Control Lists (GCLs)
- Preparation of simulation files for OMNeT++

This example highlights how TAS-Forge simplifies TAS schedule creation, allowing users to generate, validate, and analyze time-sensitive network schedules efficiently.

# ü™ú Step-by-Step Showcase: Creating TAS Schedules with TAS-Forge
This showcase follows the step-by-step walkthrough as detailed in the [User Guide](../../documentation/User_Guide.md). 

## üíª Step 1: Configure the Network Topology
- Open MATLAB and navigate to the TAS-Forge project folder.
- Run the following script:
  <pre>
  generate_network_system  
  </pre>
- Enter the number of üü• **sources**, üü¢ **sinks** & üü¶ **switches** in the input text box as shown below:
  
![Input Prompt](images/input_prompt.png)

- A network topology will be automatically generated and displayed as shown below:

![Network Topology](images/network_topology.png)

- The script also generates a set of **source-to-sink** routes:
<pre>
Source to Sink Pairs:
source5 ---> sink1
source4 ---> sink2
source1 ---> sink3
source2 ---> sink4
source3 ---> sink3  
</pre>

- The `generate_network_system.m` script also generates `.csv` files containing information relevant to:
    - **Node clock drift information** (`node_data.csv`) for time synchronization modeling
    - **Network parameters** (`network_data.csv`) such as, link speeds, propagation delays, hyperperiod, etc.
    - **Stream definitions and properties** (`stream_data.csv`) such as, stream ids, routes, periodicity, payload size, deadlines
- Upon sucessful creation, the following messages will appear in the MATLAB command window.
<pre>
Node output file "node_data.csv" has been created.
Network output file "network_data.csv" has been created.
Stream output file "stream_data.csv" has been created.
Port connections output file "port_connections.csv" has been created.  
</pre> 
- The script also creates the `CPLEX_Code_Output` folder containing the `.mod` files for all supported scheduling frameworks. The MATLAB will display: 
<pre>
Directory created for storing CPLEX codes.
Output file "output_CPLEX_code_generator_WCD.mod" has been generated in the CPLEX_Code_Output folder.
Output file "output_CPLEX_code_generator_NCD.mod" has been generated in the CPLEX_Code_Output folder.
Output file "output_CPLEX_code_generator_WCA.mod" has been generated in the CPLEX_Code_Output folder.
Output file "output_CPLEX_code_generator_NCA.mod" has been generated in the CPLEX_Code_Output folder.  
</pre>
- An empty text file `inpute_cplex_solution.txt` is also generated to enter the outputs from IBM CPLEX as explained in **Step 2**. The MATLAB command window will output. 
<pre>
Empty text file to input solution generated by CPLEX has been created.
</pre>

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Solve TAS Schedule using IBM CPLEX
- From the `CPLEX_Code_Output` folder select the `output_CPLEX_code_generator_WCD.mod` file. 
- Launch CPLEX Optimization Study and after creating an OLP project, run the `.mod` file.
- Once executed, the following **decison variables** outputs should be generated in the **Solutions** tab in CPLEX studio.
<pre>
lambda_1 = 1198.2;
lambda_2 = 1733.2;
lambda_3 = 2268.2;
lambda_4 = 2803.2;
lambda_5 = 2803.2;
OFF_1_source5 = 2859;
OFF_1_switch2 = 3394;
OFF_1_switch3 = 3929;
OFF_2_source2 = 15000;
OFF_2_switch1 = 15535;
OFF_2_switch2 = 16070;
OFF_2_switch3 = 16605;
OFF_3_source4 = 6822;
OFF_3_switch1 = 7357;
OFF_3_switch2 = 7892;
OFF_3_switch3 = 8427;
OFF_3_switch4 = 8962;
OFF_4_source1 = 27324;
OFF_4_switch1 = 27859;
OFF_4_switch2 = 28394;
OFF_4_switch3 = 28929;
OFF_4_switch4 = 29464;
OFF_4_switch5 = 29999;
OFF_5_source3 = 0;
OFF_5_switch1 = 535;
OFF_5_switch2 = 1070;
OFF_5_switch3 = 1605;
OFF_5_switch4 = 2140;
OFF_5_switch5 = 2675;
