# User Guide
This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for using TAS-Forge — from setting up the software environment to generating schedules, running simulations, and analyzing results.

Before getting started, please ensure that all required tools (MATLAB, IBM CPLEX, and OMNeT++) are properly installed and configured, along with any necessary dependencies. For details on supported versions and setup instructions, refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section below.

For a deeper understanding of the tool's design, functionality, and scheduling model, see the [Technical Overview](Technical_Overview.md) documentation.

To review current limitations and known issues encoutered in the tool, refer to the [Known Issues and Limitations](Issues_and_Limitations.md) page.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
For implementing TAS-Forge, it is vital that the following software tools are installed correct and configured:

### 1. MATLAB
- Required for: Topology generation, CPLEX and OMNeT++ code generation, TAS schedule creation, and performance analysis from simulation outputs.
- Recommended Version: R2021b or later.
- Tip: Ensure MATLAB is added to your system’s environment PATH if you intend to run it from the terminal.

### 2. IBM CPLEX
- Required for: Solving TAS scheduling frameworks formulated as Integer Linear Programs (ILPs).
- Recommended Version: CPLEX Optimization Studio 22.1.1 or later.
- Installation Steps:
    - Download from the official [IBM CPLEX Download Page](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/downloading-ibm-ilog-cplex-optimization-studio-2211)
- Note:
    - You may need to create an IBM account to access the download.
    - CPLEX must be run via the IBM GUI, as MATLAB integration is not supported in newer versions (22.x and beyond).

### 3. OMNeT++ 
- Required for: Simulating the generated network topology and validate the TAS schedule execution.
- Recommended Version: OMNeT++ 6.0.1 or newer.
- Dependencies: Requires INET version 4.4.
- Installation Steps:
        - Download OMNeT++ from the [OMNeT++ Download Page](https://omnetpp.org/download/).
        - Download INET from the [INET Download Page](https://inet.omnetpp.org/2022-05-16-INET-4.4.0-released.html).
- Note:
      - The .ned and .ini files generated by TAS-Forge should be imported in an OMNeT++ project for simulation.
