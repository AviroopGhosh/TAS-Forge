# User Guide
This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for using TAS-Forge — from setting up the software environment to generating schedules, running simulations, and analyzing results.

Before getting started, please ensure that all required tools (MATLAB, IBM CPLEX, and OMNeT++) are properly installed and configured, along with any necessary dependencies. For details on supported versions and setup instructions, refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section below.

For a deeper understanding of the tool's design, functionality, and scheduling model, see the [Technical Overview](Technical_Overview.md) documentation.

To review current limitations and known issues encoutered in the tool, refer to the [Known Issues and Limitations](Issues_and_Limitations.md) page.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
For implementing TAS-Forge, it is vital that the following software tools are installed correct and configured:

### 1. MATLAB
- Required for: Topology generation, CPLEX and OMNeT++ code generation, TAS schedule creation, CSV output analysis
- Recommended Version: R2021b or later
- Tip: Ensure MATLAB is added to your system’s environment PATH if you intend to run it from the terminal.
