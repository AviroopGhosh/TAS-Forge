# Issues and Known Limitations
TAS-Forge is designed to provide a robust and flexible framework for generating TAS schedules. However, the tool is evolving and like any evolving tool, it has a number of known limitations with areas for improvement. These are outlined below to provide transparency and guide future development.

## üìè Linear Topology
TAS-Forge currently supports only linear topologies for simulation. While this structure simplifies analysis and serves as a useful baseline, real-world TSN deployments often involve more complex topologies such as ring, tree, or mesh, particularly to support redundancy and fault tolerance etc. Extending TAS-Forge to support these topologies is left as future work to enable more comprehensive and application-relevant studies.

## ‚úãLimitations on Certain Values
While TAS-Forge offers users flexibility to configure various parameters, such as the number of devices, certain other value selections may lead to functional or performance limitations. The specific constraints and their potential impact are detailed below.

### ‚è≤Ô∏èSynchronization Periodicity:
By default, TAS-Forge uses a synchronization periodicity of 125 ms, as recommended by IEEE 802.1AS. This value can be modified to other log2-based intervals, such as:
- 2‚Åª‚Å¥ = 62.5 ms
- 2‚Åª¬π = 0.5 s

To adjust this, modify the following line in `generate_network_system.m`:
<pre>
T_sync = 0.125; % Synchronization periodicity in seconds  
</pre>

Note: Reducing the synchronization periodicity (e.g., below 125 ms) may cause synchronization messages to interfere with time-sensitive traffic, potentially leading to frame collisions or scheduling violations. Therefore, care should be taken when modifying this parameter.

### üêå Link Speed:
In TAS-Forge, all network links are configured by default to operate at 1 Gigabit Ethernet (1 GE). This is defined in the generate_network_system.m file using the parameter:

<pre>
data_rate = 1e9; % Bitrate in bits per second  
</pre>

While this value can technically be modified, it is not recommended, as multiple references to the link speed are hardcoded within the generated OMNeT++ configuration files. Changing the link speed would require updating all corresponding references across the simulation setup, which is error-prone and labor-intensive. As such, link speed customization is left as a future enhancement for improved flexibility.

### üî¨ Macrotick Granularity:
The default macrotick granularity in TAS-Forge is 0.1 ¬µs with other recomended values of 0.01 ¬µs or 1 ¬µs, representing the time resolution used for Gate Control Lists (GCLs). While this value can be adjusted to increase or decrease resolution, setting it to a finer granularity (i.e., below 0.1 ¬µs) may lead to alignment issues, as the GCL entries may no longer match correctly with computed scheduling offsets. This can result in timing mismatches and unintended behavior during simulation.

## üëπ List of Errors
During the TAS-Forge workflow, certain errors may arise that prevent successful execution. Below is a list of common errors and their causes, along with suggestions. There error messages generated by MATLAB are enclosed by `!!!` markers and are displayed in the MATLAB command window.

### Switch and Sink Connections
This error occurs when a single source is connected to multiple switches, violating the assumption of a linear topology. It indicates that the current configuration does not allow for a valid linear path based on the number of switches and the arrangement of sources and sinks. To resolve this, adjust the topology parameters to ensure that each source and sink pair can be uniquely connected in a linear fashion.sting the topology to rectify this issue. 

<pre>
!!! Not enough switches to make unique connections to each sink !!!
