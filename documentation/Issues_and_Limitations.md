# Issues and Known Limitations
TAS-Forge is designed to provide a robust and flexible framework for generating TAS schedules. However, the tool is evolving and like any evolving tool, it has a number of known limitations with areas for improvement. These are outlined below to provide transparency and guide future development.

## üìè Linear Topology
TAS-Forge currently supports only linear topologies for simulation. While this structure simplifies analysis and serves as a useful baseline, real-world TSN deployments often involve more complex topologies such as ring, tree, or mesh, particularly to support redundancy and fault tolerance. Extending TAS-Forge to support these topologies is left as future work to enable more comprehensive and application-relevant studies.
