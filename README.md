# TAS-Forge
This repository offers a comprehensive framework for the automatic generation (forging) of Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) IEEE 802.1Qbv Gate Control List (GCL) schedules, incorporating time synchronization (IEEE 802.1AS) considerations as part of the scheduling process.

# Overview
Creating TAS schedules using linear programming methods can be highly complex, especially when working with networks that have multiple time sensitive streams. Manually defining the scheduling constraints
